# Glitch will attempt the following

1. Given a semi-constant brain processing rate, Glitch will try to push the efficientcy higher by associating only the most used words in the english language to short burst, machine generated sounds to generate a pseudo language(Glitch).

2. To simplify Glitch to convey as much data as possible within a given set of sounds based around the average limitations of my own brain.

There are only two ways in which a brain can import data more quickly that I'm currently aware of. 

 - Proccess Faster (I'm resource and techno locked at the moment. Elon's lace vision would be one potential answer. Please do hurry Elon or hire me to work on it.)
 - Increase the speed of reception and/or verbosity of information at the time of reception. 

This project will center around the second. 

It seems to have been proven that data can be conveyed and understood at a much higher rate than typical spoken word as regular use of 2xSpeed video or audio is intelligible. I haven't tried yet but look forward to 2.5x and perhaps 3x speed integration soon. 

- Once Glitch has been completed, the idea is to perform a series of audio recognition lessons on myself until some level of fluency, if any, can be achieved. (I'm optimistic)
- If a reasonable level of fluency can be achieved, Glitch will be iterated over for a possible "shorthand" version to be produced. 
- Whether a "shorthand" can be achieved or not, the final success criteria would be for the speed of Glitch to be increased as close to the point of incoherence as possible without losing comprehension.

I came across this idea by listening to binary and associating it to particular 8bit sounds that were used to identify Pokemon during my childhood gameboy adventures. This is one idea of many that I've had to combat the current limitations of my brain's processing speed.

Alone, I don't believe that Glitch will have much usefullness other than to prove my own curiosity true/false. I believe that the real power of Glitch of something similar is after our Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI's) have improved to a point that allows for fast and reliable brain input/output processing. 

# Imagine:

A BCI processor that is able to translate a person's thoughts into Glitch and convey the data through a Relay. 

Now imagine another human that receives the Glitch message through their receiver and their processor sends it directly to the brain. 

Efficiency will have been improved over speech. I believe that wireless telepathic communication is an inevitability given a continued rate of technological advancement.
